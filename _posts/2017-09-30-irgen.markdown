## `IRGen` is `Arduino-IRremote` stripped of its Arduino dependencies. It runs on a desktop computer and simply generates raw IR codes for supported devices, printing them to `stdout`.

***

### Build
Build using the provided Makefile:
```sh
make all
```

Or use cmake:
```sh
mkdir -p cmake-build-debug
cd cmake-build-debug
cmake ..
make
```

This should build all demos in the `cmake-build-debug` directory.
Tested on clang (Mac OSX 10.12.6) and g++ (Ubuntu 16.04).


### Usage
Run the demo executables in the `cmake-build-debug` directory.
All demos support the `--help` command line switch, which can be used to view supported operations and device dependant usage instructions.

By default all demos print raw code output to `stdout` and exit with `EXIT_SUCCESS` on success. Errors and usage instructions are sent to `stderr` with `EXIT_FAILURE` exit code.
This guarantees calling programs that `stdout` will always only contain raw code output. This also allows the output to be piped to another program if that is desired.


### Use cases
You might want to use `IRGen` if: 

* You wanted to try `Arduino-IRremote` and didn't have an Arduino.
* You wanted to run `Arduino-IRremote` on some unsupported hardware.
* You wanted to generate your raw codes elsewhere (eg. on an IoT cloud/gateway) and send them to your IoT edge devices.
