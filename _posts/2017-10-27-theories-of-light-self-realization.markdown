## Over the centuries our (scientific) approach towards the study of light has evolved, and we have presented here an analogy between this evolution of approach (realization) with the realization of *HAQ*. In this, our approach would be to only mention the similarities and not discuss them.

> <u>Note:</u><br/>
> Words that are capitalized and italicized are borrowed from *SUFI* terminology (mostly Arabic).
> Refer to the glossary at the end of this post for their meanings.

## **The law** <br/>(*SHARIATH*)
The foundation of a religion. It usually includes a set of rules to abide by, a defined way of life, a character to imbibe, a way of life.<br/>
This is also the first step to realization in our view and our view is that inspiration uses knowledge and imagination as its means of manifestation.<br/>
Now, amongst the first theories of light is the ray theory, which mainly deals with light as a ray, which travels in a straight line (rectilinear propagation). The theory successfully explains reflection and is quite straightforward. An important feature of this theory is that it believes light's interaction with all matter is indiscriminatory.<br/>
The theory would suffice to explain the most basic aspects of light.

## **The spirituality** <br/>(*TAREEKATH*)
The wave theory of light succeeded the ray theory.<br/>
Here light is viewed as an electromagnetic wave. It has two components - electrical and magnetic. This theory explains the three exceptional phenomena that ray theory could not - diffraction, scattering, and refraction (bending of light). <br/>
This means that light interacts differently with sharp edges and with materials with a different property (refractive index and attenuation coefficient).<br/>
Secondly, this theory also deals with colors as varying wavelengths. White light now appears to have hidden all colors within it.

## **The reality/essence** <br/>(*MAARIFATH-o-HAQEEQATH*)
The particle theory of light succeeded the wave theory. Here, light is considered as a quantized beam of particles called photons. <br/>
Ironically, in essence photons are particles, much similar to what forms matter. And science has gone far enough to have proven that energy and mass are interconvertible (courtesy Einstein).<br/>
And we also know that all energy has an associated wavelength and hence frequency (courtesy Plank). Hence, light now can be viewed as energy and I prefer to broaden the understanding of *NOOR* to mean energy. <br/>
It is quite funny that science has gone so far, and people who claim to possess understanding of religion continue to fight over matters of *NOOR* (energy) - *BASHAR* (matter). 

Now, it is worth mentioning that light today is accepted to have dual nature (wave and particle), and hence both wave theory and particle theory are accepted, leading to the term `duality of light`.
For a layman though, the ray theory of light seems to suffice. Exceptions and miracles rarely bother laymen! Call it indifference, laziness, ignorance, as you please!<br/>
But to those who seek, their thirst does not die! And people of insight do not indulge in debates. A student who is only familiar with ray theory, how can he even discuss (leave alone debate) topics pertaining to wave/particle theory! <br/>
But indeed there are those who seek and those who know!<br/>
