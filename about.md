I’m **Shoaib Ahmed** – a software developer who loves programming, poetry & philosophy.

I'm mostly into design & development of software solutions for IOT - ranging from system software for fail-safe high availability cloud servers, to firmware & middleware development for embedded systems, to web and mobile application development.

I’m also a decent urdu Sufi poet and self-proclaimed philosopher. I have composed in excess of a dozen [*ghazals*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghazal) and have written a couple of short discourses on metaphysical & epistemological philosophy based on the writings of Al-Ghazel, Rene Descartes & Immanuel Kant. 
***Sufi-Al-Hussaini*** is my *nom-de-plume* (pen name).


## Areas of work
I've worked extensively with lightweight messaging protocols and frameworks for IOT like [MQTT](mqtt.org/) and [KAA Project](www.kaaproject.org/), POSIX network and system programming, SDK development (in C) & bindings in multiple languages (like Python and Swift), and third party SDK integrations. 

I've also done a fair bit of firmware & middleware development for embedded systems (ARM, AVR, etc.), mobile application development (for iOS) and web development (using Laravel & Django frameworks).

I've made some notable contributions to several open-source projects and I'm actively involved in open source communities such as [mosquitto](https://mosquitto.org/) and [sunxi](http://linux-sunxi.org/Main_Page).

Details of projects I have worked on can be viewed in my [resume](https://www.dropbox.com/s/lgx3tuna904k2sl/shoaib_ahmed.pdf?dl=0).
