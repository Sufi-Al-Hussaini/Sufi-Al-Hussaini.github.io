I’m **Shoaib Ahmed** – a software developer who loves programming, poetry & philosophy.

I architected and wrote the software for Oman's first and largest indigenous IoT cloud platform and its embedded gateway devices.
I also co-authored Packt's (UK based publisher) video series - 'IoT for Software Architects'.

I'm a free software proponent and author of many popular open-source projects.

I’m also a decent urdu Sufi poet and self-proclaimed philosopher. I have composed in excess of a dozen [*ghazals*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghazal) and have written a couple of short discourses on metaphysical & epistemological philosophy based on the writings of Al-Ghazel, Rene Descartes & Immanuel Kant. 
***Sufi-Al-Hussaini*** is my *nom-de-plume* (pen name).

### Areas of work
I'm mostly into design & development of software solutions for IoT - ranging from system software for fail-safe high availability cloud servers, to firmware & middleware development for embedded systems, to web and mobile application development.

I've worked extensively with lightweight messaging protocols and frameworks for IoT like [MQTT](mqtt.org/) and [KAA Project](www.kaaproject.org/), POSIX network and system programming, SDK development (in C & C++) and bindings in multiple languages (like Python and Swift), and third party SDK integrations. 

I've also done a fair bit of firmware & middleware development for embedded systems (ARM, AVR, etc.), mobile application development (for iOS) and web development (using Laravel & Django frameworks).

I've made some notable contributions to several open-source projects and I'm actively involved in open source communities such as [mosquitto](https://mosquitto.org/) and [sunxi](http://linux-sunxi.org/Main_Page).
