## A collection of my urdu *ghazals* and couplets, all of which are composed in classical persian meters. 

***

For readers who don't know urdu - I do intend to add english translations to all my poetic works in the (near) future. The posts themselves are written in roman urdu, so you might just want to read them anyway (for the sake of rhythm).
